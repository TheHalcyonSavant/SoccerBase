SoccerBase - Statistical predictions on soccer matches
============================================
The intention of this project was to create stable statistical analysis on soccer matches that would give me enough correct prediction to start betting on soccer. Unfortunately the forecast percentage were too law to compete with the major bookmakers on every prediction type (1,x,2), regardless of teams, leagues and their overall strategic form. So, the project ceased development and I'm publishing the codes as open source :(

>This was my first serious project in C#, so please forgive my unworldly mistakes :)
